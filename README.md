# Lion is an open-source CLI tool that makes developers lives easier
## Lion is a project ready for use but still under development
It helps by creating the file with some preset code and add external dependencies for you (implemented for rust and python)

See the
[Docs](DOCS.md)
on how to use it and which languages are supported for which command:

- [x] Creates the file
- [x] Adds preset code
- [x] Add external dependencies - Added for rust and python
- [x] Allow dependency feature to be called individually
- [x] Add a compiling + running feature
- [x] Project creation with a preset file structure

- [ ] Project creation abilities
- [ ] Automatic linking of external libraries with git
- [ ] Reliance on lion.toml for running rather than a Cargo.toml (allowing for external dependencies to be used more easily)
- [ ] Don't require external compilers (use a compiler based inside lion)
- [ ] Additional features coming soon

## Current list of supported languages:
  - ### Rust
  - ### Python
  - ### C++
  - C
  - Go
  - Java
